/*
Write a program in C++ to find the perfect numbers between 1 and 500.
The perfect numbers between 1 to 500 are:
6
28
496

In number theory, 
a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
